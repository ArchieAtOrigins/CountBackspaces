# CountBackspaces
A Project to count a coders backspaces
This has evolved somewhat. It is currently becoming a browser app that keeps track of a users backspace/delete key entries.
The object is to help a user reduce there corrections and ultimately to improve their accuracy and shave of those valuable milliseconds of coding time.
Over time I hope to have it keep score in some fashion, and take on more of a game-like face, providing those little dopamine kicks when
improvements,new high scores, etc, are achieved.
